What is mykernel script?
    Script to create recovery flashable arm64 kernel zips.

Steps in order
1)  Creates kernel_srcs, toolchains, out, zip folders.
2)  Gets kernel git link.
3)  Gets kernel git branch/tag
4)  Clones kernel to kernel_srcs/<kernel folder name determined by git>
5)  Gets defconfig by listing the filenames of kernel_srcs/<kernel folder name determined by git>/arch/arm64/configs
        <kernel folder name determined by git> folder name is read by running recently created folder command.
6)  Choose among following toolchains
                *AOSP-GCC (4.9)
                *ARM-GNU-GCC (8.2)
                *Bootlin (Stable - gcc 6.4.0 & Bleeding Edge - gcc 8.2.0)
                *Linaro (7.3.1)
7)  Clones/downloads/extracts toolchain depending on the availability of tarball/toolchain_folder in the working folder.
8)  Clears out dirctory.
9)  Compiles the kernel.
10) Clears zip directory.
11) Clones anykernel2  from https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel2 by @osm0sis
12) Appends 'mykernel' to kernel string, alters device/ramdisk specific lines in anykernel.sh
13) Creates recovery flashable arm64 kernel zip.
